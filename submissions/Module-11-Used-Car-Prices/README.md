# What drives the price of a car?

### Overview

In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

### Business Understanding

From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices.  In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition.  Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary. 

### Data Understanding

After considering the business understanding, we want to get familiar with our data.  Write down some steps that you would take to get to know the dataset and identify any quality issues within.  Take time to get to know the dataset and explore what information it contains and how this could be used to inform your business understanding.

### Data Preparation

After our initial exploration and fine tuning of the business understanding, it is time to construct our final dataset prior to modeling.  Here, we want to make sure to handle any integrity issues and cleaning, the engineering of new features, any transformations that we believe should happen (scaling, logarithms, normalization, etc.), and general preparation for modeling with `sklearn`. 

### Modeling

With your (almost?) final dataset in hand, it is now time to build some models.  Here, you should build a number of different regression models with the price as the target.  In building your models, you should explore different parameters and be sure to cross-validate your findings.

### Evaluation

With some modeling accomplished, we aim to reflect on what we identify as a high quality model and what we are able to learn from this.  We should review our business objective and explore how well we can provide meaningful insight on drivers of used car prices.  Your goal now is to distill your findings and determine whether the earlier phases need revisitation and adjustment or if you have information of value to bring back to your client.

### Deployment

Now that we've settled on our models and findings, it is time to deliver the information to the client.  You should organize your work as a basic report that details your primary findings.  Keep in mind that your audience is a group of used car dealers interested in fine tuning their inventory.
