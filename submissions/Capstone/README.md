# Capstone Project - Stock Market Analysis & Forecasting
This project analyzes stock-market data for the purposes of recommending one of the following actions per day, per stock analyzed:
- Buy
- Sell
- Hold

## Approach
The analysis writeup follows the CRISP-DM framework. The specific approach to answering the above questions is machine learning as applied to the stock market, AKA algorithmic trading.

## Data
Data sets were downloaded from the "Download Sample" button on the [first-rate data site](https://firstratedata.com/b/22/stock-complete-historical-intraday). Additional data sets were obtained from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) for
