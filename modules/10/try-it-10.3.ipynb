    "First, you learned about the importance of transforming your data into a stationary series. You tested for stationarity using the adfuller function and interpreted the value of the hypothesis test. If the data was not stationary, you learned how to apply strategies, such as differencing and logarithmic transformations, to achieve stationarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the series was stationary, building an ARMA model involved using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to determine the appropriate p and q parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity asks you to identify a time series of interest to you and build an ARMA model to construct a basic forecast for the series and analyze the error. You might also consider building models with different p and q parameters because, while ACF and PACF plots are helpful, they provide rough ideas of the appropriate parameters, and it is usually good practice to perform a simple grid search on these. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please find a time series dataset using any resource you would like, and present your model and findings to the class.  \n",

    "If you have trouble locating a dataset or would prefer a suggestion, try the [Rossmann Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) from Kaggle. This dataset involves forecasting retail store sales for a major drug store."
