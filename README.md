I worked with codespaces integrated in github and captured my setup below.

### Kernel
#### Pre-Installed Kernels
Select a pre-installed Python kernel  
- This has common dependencies already installed
- From the upper right, select Kernel, then choose the available python install in ~/.python

#### Virtual Environment
If you need more control over the environment, such as to install more dependencies,
- Click settings menu (bottom left gear icon)
- Choose Command Palette
- Enter Python Create Environment
- Choose a python binary
- Accept prompt to install requirements (if you have a local requirements.txt file)
